# Solaris Data Visualization App

It's a ReactJS application using TypeScript on Solaris-2.json data. Material UI and Recharts libraries are highly utilized to create interactive components. 

## Main features:
 - Interactive line chart.
 - Filtering according to different attributes (age, status, diet, date).
 - Interactive bar and pie charts from filtered data.

If you're interested, the application is also available in CodeSandbox and Google App Engine. 
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/festive-joliot-odc6n4) (It might have problems because of the size of the json data)
- [App Engine](https://solaris-342922.wn.r.appspot.com/)
